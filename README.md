# Satellite Image Forecasting - EarthNet 2021

Climate change has a large impact on our environment :earth_americas:. We notice this all around the world due to catastrophic events such as droughts occuring more and more frequently. In this project, we develop various deep learning models for the EarthNet2021 challenge (https://www.earthnet.tech/), where our task is to predict future satellite images from past ones using features such as weather and elevation maps. With one of our models, a Peephole Convolutional LSTM, we manage to beat the current best model on the EarthNet challenge leaderboard. 

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions!


## User Guide

### Training, testing and evaluating the model

Prerequisites: Create a python environment as defined in ```config/dif_env.yml```

1. Download the dataset (train/iid/ood/extreme/seasonal splits):

    ```python scripts/data_retrieval.py directory/to/store/data split```

2. Collect the paths to the data:

    ```python scripts/data_collection.py -s training/dir -tf test/dir -d dir/to/store/paths -td no/of/training/samples/ -v1 no/of/val1/samples -v2 no/of/val2/samples```

3. Train the model (use ```config/Training.json``` to edit tunable parameters):

    ```python scripts/train.py ```

4. Validate the model on the val2 set (the wandb run name can be found in the wandb/run-XYZ/files/run_name.txt file):

    ```python scripts/validate.py -rn wandb/run/name -e epoch/to/validate/on```

5. Test on the iid test set:

    ```python scripts/validate.py -rn wandb/run/name -e epoch/to/validate/on -ts iid_test_split```

6. Evaluate your (ensemble of) model:

    ```python scripts/ensemble_score.py```

### Demos and Visualizations

Our model also comes with several notebooks/scripts for data visualization, diagnostics, etc.

```demos/model_demo.ipynb``` for exploring the dataset

```demos/data_observation_demo.ipynb``` for visualizing the dataset

```scripts/diagnosticate.py -rn wandb/run/name -e epoch/to/validate/on``` for visualizing the model's predictions
